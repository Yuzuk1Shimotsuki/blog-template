## Epilogue
When I ever see a new tech product or service being released, "Technology is the future" is always kept in mind.

I am a native-born Hong Kong resident and proud of it (Before 2019... those who understand will understand). Putting aside political factors, I'm both impressed and astonished by the rapid rise of technological development in China. At the same time, I felt hopeless regarding Hong Kong's lag in scientific research and technological development. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

## My Personality
I'm a cheerful person and curious about everything.
You might think I don't usually have much to say, but that's just because I'm more introverted lol.

## My Interest
#food #cycling #rollerskating etc.

I joined the "Computer Building Lesson" held by an NGO at age 5 ‚Äì the moment that started my mind to become a computer enthusiast.

The instructor not only provided us with a detailed explanation of how computers function and the primary functions of their components but also gave us a chance to build a computer with the parts we provided, which deepened my understanding of computers.

I've also been interested in programming since age 13. I usually watch online programming tutorials and visit websites to practice my coding skills, which was tough initially. However, I enjoyed the whole process.

## Future planning
Now, I'm an EE student who studied at the City University of Hong Kong. I will dedicate myself to studying diligently to prepare for future technological developments and contribute to making the world a better place for future generations.

When I ever seen a new tech product or service is being released, "Technology is the future" is always keeping in my mind.

I'm a cheerful person, and curious on everything.

#food #cycling #rollerskating etc.

I joined the "Computer Building Lesson" held by NGO back in my primary school era â€“ the moment that kicked start my mind of becoming a computer enthusiast.

The instructor not only provided us a detailed explanation of how computers function and the major functions of its components, but also give us a chance to build a computer with provided parts by ourselves which deepened my understanding of computers.

I'm also interested in programming. I usually watch programming tutorials online and visit programming websites to practice my coding skills, which was tough for me in the beginning but I enjoyed the process.

Now, I'm a EE student who studied in City University of Hong Kong. I will dedicate myself to studying diligently to prepare for the future developments in technology and contribute to making the world a better place for future generation.
